# Notes

- emmet:
    - select + `Alt` + `Shift` + `↓` = copy and paste to next line
    - select + `Alt` + `↓` / `↑` = move up / down
    - cursor on start + `Shift` + cursor on end = select (not from session)
- `align-items` needs `height` to show any effect
- with `flex-direction: column` axis will get reversed too
- `position: absolute` needs `position: relative` on it's parent div to show any effect
    - otherwise it will be placed according to the `body`
